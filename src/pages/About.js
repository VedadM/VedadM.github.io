      <p>Web Developer with more than 20 years of experience, developing websites for various industries from entertainment to non-profits. Firm believer of making product work first (might be simple at first), then adding more complexity. This process has helped me and my clients reduce the stress of crunches and deadlines. With every project I work on, I consider it a partnership in which everyone needs to support and respect one another.</p>
      <p>Away from front-end development work, I am also a licensed Yoga instructor and personal trainer. Both of these have helped me incorporate that "meditative" approach to the Web Development process: Taking time and having patience.</p>
      <p>Some of my other hobbies are playing guitar and harmonica, hiking and photography.</p>
